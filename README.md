# Logistic-Regression
Predicting a qualitative response for observation can be referred to as classifying that observation since it involves assigning the observation to a category or class. Classification forms the basis for Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a supervised algorithm used to predict a dependent variable that is categorical or discrete. Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function.
